# ObservatoryPlugins
A suite of plugins for Elite ObservatoryCore (https://github.com/Xjph/ObservatoryCore).

For all plugins, unzip the dll into the plugins/ folder in your ObservatoryCore installation.

Feel free to open an issue if something doesn't work, or reach out in the ObservatoryCore discord.

## Fleet Commander

### Release notes: 0.0.92.1935-beta
As of Odyssey Update 9 (Dec. 2021), the game is not writing "CarrierJump" events to the journal file
(see https://issues.frontierstore.net/issue-detail/46996), resulting in slightly degraded functionality
when jumping your carrier while not docked on it.

As of Odyssey Update 11 (Mar. 2022), the game is not writing StationName/StationType properties to location
events, further complicating matters. I've managed to work around this for the moment.

## Prospector

### Release notes: 0.0.92.1935-beta

Finally, a release! Update 11 triggered some updates which mean the bug I was blocked on is fixed in the
latest version of Observatory Core!

Give these a try and let me know if you have any issues!
