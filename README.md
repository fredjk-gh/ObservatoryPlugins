# ObservatoryPlugins
A suite of plugins for Elite ObservatoryCore (https://github.com/Xjph/ObservatoryCore).

For either plugin, simply unzip the dll and drop it in the plugins/ folder in your ObservatoryCore installation.

Feel free to open an issue if something doesn't work, or reach out in the ObservatoryCore discord.

## Fleet Commander

### Release notes: 0.0.30.1958
As of Odyssey Update 9 (Dec. 2021), the game is not writing "CarrierJump" events to the journal file
(see https://issues.frontierstore.net/issue-detail/46996), resulting in slightly degraded functionality
when jumping your carrier while not docked on it.

## Prospector

### Release notes: No release yet

There is no release for this plugin yet because it depends on code that is newer than the latest release
of Observatory Core (Dec. 18, 2021): https://github.com/Xjph/ObservatoryCore/pull/49.

However, if you're running from a local debug build, it should run fine if you are caught up to latest version.
