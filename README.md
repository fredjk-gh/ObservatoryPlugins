# ObservatoryPlugins
A suite of plugins for Elite ObservatoryCore (https://github.com/Xjph/ObservatoryCore).

Feel free to open an issue if something doesn't work, or reach out in the ObservatoryCore discord.

# Installation

The download is an `.eop` file.

*  If you installed Observatory Core via the installer, just close Observatory Core and double click the `.eop` file. Observatory Core will launch, and unpack the plugin (and any dependencies) for you. If you have more than one plugin to install, close Observatory Core and repeat.
*  If you installed Observatory Core via a `.zip` package, simply copy the `.eop` file(s) into the `.\plugins` sub-folder of your installation location and re-launch Observatory Core.

# Plugins

## AutoUpdater

This plugin keeps all plugins listed here (including itself) up-to-date after installation. After a release of an installed plugin is posted to GitHub, it will download the updated versions so it can be used after ObservatoryCore is restarted.

After installation, be sure to enable the plugin and configure any other options you wish.

NOTE: To enable auto-updating any plugin listed as "Beta", below, you will need to enable the "Use beta options" option.
