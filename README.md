# ObservatoryPlugins
A suite of plugins for Elite ObservatoryCore (https://github.com/Xjph/ObservatoryCore).

Feel free to open an issue if something doesn't work, or reach out in the ObservatoryCore discord.

# Installation

The download is an `.eop` file.

*  If you installed Observatory Core via the installer, just close Observatory Core and double click the `.eop` file. Observatory Core will launch, and unpack the plugin (and any dependencies) for you. If you have more than one plugin to install, close Observatory Core and repeat.
*  If you installed Observatory Core via a `.zip` package, simply copy the `.eop` file(s) into the `.\plugins` sub-folder of your installation location and re-launch Observatory Core.
